# Secret Santa Website

This is a [website](https://tess-flinsen.github.io/secret-santa/) that helps to play the Secret Santa game. The page was created as a part of Web Development class to show basic skills in HTML, CSS and JavaScript. It was based on the following [figma design](https://www.figma.com/file/SB6ay7ppbW4Cw4fpyvkGQ5/Secret-Santa---Christmas-Landing-Page-Completed-(Community)?type=design&node-id=0-1&mode=design&t=etEdYsRmXmlxcNqM-0).
