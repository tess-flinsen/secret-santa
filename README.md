# Secret Santa Website

This is a [website](https://tess-flinsen.github.io/secret-santa/) that helps to play the Secret Santa game. All the links and buttons lead to the main form at the bottom of the main page. It returns the saved data of a randomly picked previous visitor upon submission. If there were no visitors, it should display a message "We will send you our helper soon!"

***

The page was created as a part of Web Development class to show basic skills in HTML, CSS and JavaScript. It was based on the following [figma design](https://www.figma.com/file/SB6ay7ppbW4Cw4fpyvkGQ5/Secret-Santa---Christmas-Landing-Page-Completed-(Community)?type=design&node-id=0-1&mode=design&t=etEdYsRmXmlxcNqM-0). 

All the data submitted is saved in cookies. Please fill the form in a decent manner and take care of your private information.
